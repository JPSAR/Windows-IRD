# Windows-IRD
Take a blast from the past! Windows IRD is a WIn 9x styled (kinda) Parody OS of, well, windows! Enjoy the jank, unstable funny s**its and giggles that may or may not happen when running this OS. This is a point-and-click game, so you need a mouse or touchpad to play. To set up on Windows:Get the installer and run it, following the instructions prompted.if it doesn't work, get the portable zip instead, extracting and running the executable.  If Windows gets mad about the software, just say yes to running it.To set up on Mac:Get and extract the zip file, and run the app, ignore the error, and then right-click(control-click) on the app, and click open, then click open again. The game should run fine at that point, and you can put the app in your application folder.
